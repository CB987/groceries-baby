<h1>Groceries-Baby</h1>
<h4>Concept</h4>
I want to create an app that connects:
  <ul>
    <li>grocery list (ordered by location in store) linked to</li>
    <li>ingredients in recipes linked to (with recipe api search?)</li>
    <li>faves recipe db that we can add to and then ask it to bring back 5 random recipes</li>
    <li>calendar that shows when those recipes were made that also shows</li>
    <li>to-do list with dates due, including errands, with a</li>
    <li>map that will put the places you have to go in the most efficient order</li> 
    <li>including grocery shopping, with links to...</li>
    <li>grocery list (see above)</li>
   </ul>https://trello.com/c/9KCrTZXM/51-06-19-2020
